This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl programming: an out-of-range index error when accessing list elements.  The `bug.tcl` file shows the problematic code, which throws an error when accessing an index beyond the list bounds.  The `bugSolution.tcl` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.  This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in Tcl scripts to prevent unexpected crashes and improve program stability.
